## Macro Keyboard



Hello, this is my Macro Keyboard Project and I hope you like it. I would like to have extra keys to use with my Linux environment and make my day more productive, not just for that, I wanted to make a Foot Switch for my games and I got here, at this point in the live...

I have three folders here and each folder has a project type, below you see the descriptions:

- [**macrokeyboard**](https://github.com/BRVN01/promicro_key/tree/main/macrokeyboard)

  If you are starting with QMK Firmware you should see this project and read its README. It's a bit complicated at first but the tutorial is easy to read and I hope it helps you, please like this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXNDS9b0Yxw) and subscribe to the channel if possible because it helped me a lot.

- [**arduino-ide**](https://github.com/BRVN01/promicro_key/tree/main/arduino-ide)

  If you are looking for a way to create an extra key for your games I succeeded create this project because the keyboard in Arduino IDE is lighter than QMK firmware (I think the reason is obvious) so for you game I recommend this project but you decided.

- [**skey**](https://github.com/BRVN01/promicro_key/tree/main/skey)

  Here we have the last but not least project and the difference between *skey* and *macrokeyboard* is that in the first I didn't use layers and in the second I used; In other words, skey is kind of complicated than the *macrokeyboard*, but not as complicated as.

  I know what but my Linux and Windows system doesn't recognize F13-F24 keys, so I had an idea to use combo keys like ALT+NUMBER when Number is a KeyPad number to create your functions on Linux (I haven't tested this on Windows but I think it works).
